\section{Conclusion}
This research project has explored the applicability of existing alternative asset investing models to digital assets, focusing on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), price prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, and volatility analysis with the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. The study aimed to address the fundamental question: "\textit{To what extent can existing alternative asset investing models be applied to digital assets?}"

In conclusion, the rapid growth and increasing relevance of digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies, in the global financial landscape have highlighted the imperative for rigorous research into adapting or augmenting traditional asset models to evaluate these assets effectively. As outlined in the introduction, digital assets possess unique characteristics such as high volatility, diverse liquidity profiles, and an evolving regulatory environment. These distinctive features present both challenges and opportunities that demand careful consideration for investors navigating this burgeoning market.

The CAPM analysis revealed insightful findings regarding the risk-return tradeoffs of various asset classes compared to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies exhibited significantly higher betas, indicating greater volatility and systemic risk compared to traditional equities, bonds, and commodities. Despite their higher risk profile, cryptocurrencies generally offered lower expected returns during the study period, highlighting the importorance of managing risks where higher risk comes at a higher cost. This analysis suggests that while CAPM provides a framework for understanding risk and return relationships, its direct application to digital assets may require adjustments to account for their unique risk characteristics.

Using LSTM models for price prediction provided further insights into the predictive capabilities for digital assets. The results showed varying levels of accuracy across different cryptocurrencies, highlighting the potential for machine learning techniques to capture complex market dynamics and inform investment decisions. LSTM models demonstrated their utility in forecasting cryptocurrency prices, although their performance varied depending on the asset and market conditions. This underscores the importance of leveraging advanced computational methods to navigate the volatility and informational inefficiencies inherent in digital asset markets.

The GARCH model analysis elucidated the volatility dynamics of cryptocurrencies and traditional assets over the study period. Cryptocurrencies exhibited notably higher volatility compared to equities and commodities, underscoring their susceptibility to price fluctuations and market sentiment. The GARCH model's ability to capture time-varying volatility patterns provided valuable insights into risk management strategies for digital asset portfolios. By quantifying and understanding volatility, investors can better assess risk-adjusted returns and tailor their investment strategies accordingly.

Integrating findings from CAPM, LSTM price prediction, and GARCH volatility analysis contributes to a comprehensive understanding of digital asset investment dynamics. While traditional asset models like CAPM offer foundational insights into risk and return, they require adaptation to accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets, such as the high volatility. LSTM models enhance predictive accuracy in price forecasting, aiding in portfolio optimization and risk management. The GARCH model's volatility analysis facilitates informed decision-making by identifying periods of heightened risk and potential opportunities.

While existing alternative asset models provide a valuable framework for evaluating digital assets, their direct application requires careful consideration and adaptation. Digital assets present distinct challenges and opportunities that necessitate innovative approaches and continuous research. As the digital asset market matures and regulatory frameworks evolve, further advancements in modeling techniques and empirical research will enhance our ability to effectively integrate digital assets into diversified investment portfolios.
