Notes

### Models


#### Time Series Forecasting 
**Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)**: ARIMA models are commonly used for time series forecasting. They capture the linear dependencies between observations and can be applied to predict future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: LSTM networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), are effective for modeling time series data with long-term dependencies, making them suitable for predicting cryptocurrency price

#### Quantitative Modeling
**Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model**: While originally developed for pricing financial options, the Black-Scholes model and its variations can be adapted to estimate the fair value of cryptocurrency options and derivatives, providing insights into market expectations and volatility.

**GARCH Models**: Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are used to model and forecast volatility in financial time series data. They can be applied to estimate and predict cryptocurrency price volatility, which is essential for risk management and option pricing.

#### Classification Models
**Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

**Random Forests**

#### Reinforcement Learning
**Q-Learning**

**Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
