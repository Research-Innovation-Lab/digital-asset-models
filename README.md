## Asset Classes
- Stocks (5 TOP INDIVDUAL STOCKS)
- ETF (S&P500)
- Bonds 
- Real Estate (INDEX FUND / MUTUAL FUND)
- Cryptocurrency (10+ cryptocurrencies, BITW (Bitwise 10 Crypto Index)

- 
## Outline

**1. Introduction**

**2. Overview of Existing Alternative Asset Models and Their Key Principles**
- explain all the models, the equations.
- history of models, what they do, who came up with it.

**3. Digital Asset Landscape**
- rise of cryptocurrency
- cryptocurrency and applications
- main research question
- can we apply existing asset models

**4. Crpytocurrency Overview / Data Preparatiton**
- introduce the 10 cryptocurrencies
- what kind of data and how
- where the data is coming from

**5. Process and Results**
- actual results and how we did it

CAPM 
- equivalent of risk-free rate in cryptocurrency
- stocks, commodities, real estate, no bonds (YTM)

**5a. Model #1**

**5b. Model #2**

**5c. Model #3**

**5d. Model #4**

**5e. Model #5**

**6. Analysis**

**6a. Risk and Return Analysis**
- CAPM - Traditional Asset Models

risk and return of top 10 cryptocurrencies
compare to stocks for same period, 10 stocks, and what's the risk and return of the top 10 stocks
compare bonds over the same time period
commodities same time period (gold, silver)
real estate index

**6b. Volatility Analysis**
- GARCH
- Stochastic Model - GBM
- find another model
- possibly more models

Yes, they can be applied to some extent, show the volatility of cryptocurrency and volatility of stocks

**6c. Valuation Techniques**
- Relative Valuation Models (Network Value to Transactions) (Comparative Analysis)
- Absolute Valuation Models - Equation of Exchange (Intrinsic Value)

- Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- Discounted Cash Flow

- P/E Ratio (find crypto equivalent)
- https://defiblog.substack.com/p/51-crypto-metrics-you-must-know-about

**6d. Price Prediction**
- LSTM
- ARIMA
- find another model

- Results are shown via MSE, RMSE, MAE.
- average returns and correlation,
Display table and results, some graphs, and show relationship in analysis.


**Optional**

**6e. Portfolio Management Strategies**
- Sharpe Ratio

- Modern Portfolio Theory

- show the ratios of different asset classes


**Conclusion**
