\begin{abstract}
This research project aims to conduct a comprehensive study on state-of-the-art alternative asset models and their application to digital assets. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, alternative assets, specifically digital assets, are gaining significant attention, and becoming increasingly relevant for investors. However, there is a lack of rigorous research and understanding of the various alternative asset investment models and their implications for digital assets. The primary research question driving this study is: "\textit{To what extent can existing alternative asset investing models be applied to digital assets?}" By examining and analyzing various alternative asset models, this research project seeks to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of applying these models to digital assets.

\section{Volatility Analysis}

Volatility analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of financial assets, particularly in the realm of alternative investments. Volatility, often regarded as a measure of risk, encapsulates the degree of uncertainty or variability in the returns of an asset over time. In the context of alternative assets, which encompass a diverse range of investment vehicles beyond traditional stocks and bonds, volatility assumes heightened significance due to the unique characteristics and dynamics inherent in these assets.

The emergence of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities, has further underscored the importance of volatility analysis in alternative asset management. These nascent and rapidly evolving asset classes exhibit distinct patterns of price fluctuations and risk profiles, necessitating sophisticated analytical tools to model and assess their volatility dynamics accurately.

Volatility analysis serves multiple purposes in the management of alternative assets. Firstly, it provides insights into the inherent risk associated with these assets, enabling investors and portfolio managers to make informed decisions regarding asset allocation, risk mitigation strategies, and portfolio diversification. Secondly, volatility analysis facilitates the estimation of potential returns and the pricing of derivative instruments, such as options and futures, which are commonly utilized in alternative asset markets for hedging and speculation purposes.

Two prominent methodologies employed in volatility analysis are the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and Stochastic Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). The GARCH model, a time-series econometric framework, is widely utilized to model the volatility clustering and persistence observed in financial asset returns. By capturing the conditional heteroskedasticity of asset returns, the GARCH model enables practitioners to forecast future volatility levels accurately and assess the risk-return characteristics of alternative assets.

On the other hand, stochastic GBM, a stochastic process widely used in mathematical finance, provides a continuous-time framework for modeling the evolution of asset prices and their associated volatility. By incorporating random fluctuations and drift components into the asset price dynamics, stochastic GBM offers a versatile approach to simulating the behavior of alternative assets under various market conditions and investment scenarios.

\subsection{Stochastic Model - GBM}

\hfill \break

The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a model used in finance to describe the random movement of asset prices. It's represented by the equation:

\[
dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t
\]

Where:

$ \bullet S_t $ is the price of the asset at time $ t $.
 
$ \bullet \mu $ is the average rate of return, or drift.

$ \bullet \sigma $ is the volatility, or standard deviation of returns.

$ \bullet dW_t $ represents the random fluctuation in the asset's price.

\hfill \break

This equation states that the change in the asset price over a small time interval \( dt \) consists of two components: a deterministic component represented by \( \mu S_t dt \), and a random component represented by \( \sigma S_t dW_t \).

\subsection{GARCH Model}

\hfill \break

The GARCH model is an econometric model that captures the time-varying volatility or variance of a time series. It assumes that the volatility of the series is autocorrelated and can be predicted based on past values of the series and past volatility.

The basic form of the GARCH(p, q) model is:

\[
\sigma_{t}^2 = \omega + \alpha_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1}^2 + \ldots + \alpha_{p}\varepsilon_{t-p}^2 + \beta_{1}\sigma_{t-1}^2 + \ldots + \beta_{q}\sigma_{t-q}^2
\]

Where:

$ \bullet \sigma_{t}^2 $ is the conditional variance at time $ t $,

$ \bullet \omega $ is the constant term,

$ \bullet \varepsilon_{t} $ is the error term at time $ t $,

$ \bullet \alpha_{i} $ and $ \beta_{i} $ are the coefficients for the squared error terms and the conditional variances at lag $ i $ respectively,

$ \bullet p $ and $ q $ are the orders of the autoregressive and moving average terms respectively.


\section{Valuation Techniques}

Valuing cryptocurrencies presents unique challenges and opportunities compared to traditional assets. The decentralized and digital nature of these assets requires innovative approaches to determine their intrinsic and market values. Below, we discuss key valuation techniques, including the collection of on-chain data and the application of relative valuation models.

\subsection{Collect On-Chain Data}

On-chain data refers to information that is recorded directly on the blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. This data provides valuable insights into the network's activity and health, which can be used to inform valuation models. Key metrics include transaction volume, active addresses, and the total value transacted on the network.

\subsubsection{Importance of On-Chain Data}

$ \bullet $ \textbf{Transparency}: On-chain data is publicly accessible, allowing analysts to observe real-time network activity.

$ \bullet $ \textbf{Market Sentiment}: High transaction volumes and active addresses can indicate strong market interest and adoption.

$ \bullet $ \textbf{Security and Reliability}: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that the data is tamper-proof and reliable.

\hfill \break

\subsubsection{Transaction Volume}

Transaction volume measures the total amount of cryptocurrency transferred within the network over a given period. High transaction volumes can signal increased usage and demand for the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to higher valuations.

\hfill \break

\subsection{Relative Valuation Models}

Relative valuation models compare the value of a cryptocurrency to other similar assets, providing a framework to assess whether a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued relative to its peers. One of the most widely used relative valuation models in the cryptocurrency space is the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio.

\hfill \break

\subsubsection{Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio}

\hfill \break

The NVT ratio is akin to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio used in equity markets. It is calculated by dividing the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency by its daily transaction volume.

\[
\text{NVT Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Daily Transaction Volume}}
\]

$ \bullet $ \textbf{Market Capitalization}: The total value of all coins in circulation, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total supply.

$ \bullet $  \textbf{Daily Transaction Volume}: The sum of all transactions made within a 24-hour period.

\hfill \break

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the NVT Ratio}

\hfill \break

$ \bullet $  \textbf{High NVT Ratio}: Indicates that the network value (market cap) is high relative to its transaction volume. This could suggest that the cryptocurrency is overvalued or that it is being used more as a store of value rather than for transactions.

$ \bullet $  \textbf{Low NVT Ratio}: Suggests that the network is undervalued relative to its transaction volume, indicating healthy network activity and potentially higher growth prospects.

\subsection{Absolute Valuation Models}

The Equation of Exchange is given by:

\[
MV = PQ
\]

Where:

$ \bullet $  $M$ is the total money supply.

$ \bullet $  $V$ is the velocity of money.

$ \bullet $ $P$ is the price level.

$ \bullet $ $Q$ is the transaction volume (or economic output).


For cryptocurrencies:
\[
\text{Intrinsic Value} = \frac{P \times Q}{V}
\]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./code/valuation-techniques/nvt_ratio.png}
    \caption{Network Value to Transactions Ratios}
    \label{fig:beta}
\end{figure}

We have to make some assumptions or gather data for $V$ (velocity), $P$ (price level), and $Q$ (transaction volume).

\hfill \break

\subsection{Application of Valuation Techniques to Cryptocurrencies}

By leveraging on-chain data and relative valuation models like the NVT ratio, investors and analysts can gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic value and market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. These techniques help in identifying investment opportunities and assessing the fundamental health of different cryptocurrency networks.

In conclusion, the integration of on-chain data and innovative valuation models provides a robust framework for analyzing and valuing cryptocurrencies. As the market for digital assets continues to evolve, these techniques will play a crucial role in guiding investment decisions and fostering a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics at play.
